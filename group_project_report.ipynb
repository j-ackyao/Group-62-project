    "\n",
    "Red wine has specific attributes (acidity, sugar, alcohol, etc.) that determine its taste and perceived quality. The quality of red wine is often evaluated by professional sommeliers, a time-consuming and subjective assessment process. Attributes of red wine and its quality rating have been determined and collected into a data set that is donated to the UCI machine learning repository. This project will take that data and attempt to answer the question, *is there a correlation between the attributes (predictors) and quality (class) of red wine?*\n",
